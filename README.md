# Easy Grocery - A web application for ordering groceries
Easy Grocery was developed with Django, PostgreSQL, HTML and CSS and it allows users to order groceries from a supermarket and have them delivered to their house. Products are seperated in categories and subcategories, and users can register, add products to the cart, increase/decrease the quantity, choose to pay by cash or card, enter their address details for the delivery of the products and view their order history.
